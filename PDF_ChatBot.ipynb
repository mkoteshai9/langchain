Load your book into a single text file 2. Split your text into large-ish chunks 3. Embed your chunks to get vectors 4. Cluster the vectors to see which are similar to each other and likely talk about the same parts of the book 5. Pick embeddings that represent the cluster the most (method: closest to each cluster centroid) 6. Summarize the documents that these embeddings represent ================ What rationale or strategy did you use to chunk the data, what options available out there, to chunk the data? https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/#Chunking-Considerations Fixed-size chunking This is the most common and straightforward approach to chunking: we simply decide the number of tokens in our chunk and, optionally, whether there should be any overlap between them. In general, we will want to keep some overlap between chunks to make sure that the semantic context doesn’t get lost between chunks. Fixed-sized chunking will be the best path in most common cases. Compared to other forms of chunking, fixed-sized chunking is computationally cheap and simple to use since it doesn’t require the use of any NLP libraries. text = \"...\" # your text from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter( separator = \"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\", chunk_size = 256, chunk_overlap  = 20 ) docs = text_splitter.create_documents([text]) • **Naive splitting:**The most naive approach would be to split sentences by periods (“.”) and new lines. While this may be fast and simple, this approach would not take into account all possible edge cases. Here’s a very simple example: text = \"...\" # your text docs = text.split(\".\") • NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular Python library for working with human language data. It provides a sentence tokenizer that can split the text into sentences, helping to create more meaningful chunks. For example, to use NLTK with LangChain, you can do the following: text = \"...\" # your text from langchain.text_splitter import NLTKTextSplitter text_splitter = NLTKTextSplitter() docs = text_splitter.split_text(text) • spaCy: spaCy is another powerful Python library for NLP tasks. It offers a sophisticated sentence segmentation feature that can efficiently divide the text into separate sentences, enabling better context preservation in the resulting chunks. For example, to use spaCy with LangChain, you can do the following: text = \"...\" # your text from langchain.text_splitter import SpacyTextSplitter text_splitter = SpaCyTextSplitter() docs = text_splitter.split_text(text) Recursive Chunking Recursive chunking divides the input text into smaller chunks in a hierarchical and iterative manner using a set of separators. If the initial attempt at splitting the text doesn’t produce chunks of the desired size or structure, the method recursively calls itself on the resulting chunks with a different separator or criterion until the desired chunk size or structure is achieved. This means that while the chunks aren’t going to be exactly the same size, they’ll still “aspire” to be of a similar size. Here’s an example of how to use recursive chunking with LangChain: text = \"...\" # your text from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( Set a really small chunk size, just to show. chunk_size = 256, chunk_overlap  = 20 ) docs = text_splitter.create_documents([text]) Specialized chunking Markdown and LaTeX are two examples of structured and formatted content you might run into. In these cases, you can use specialized chunking methods to preserve the original structure of the content during the chunking process. • Markdown: Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text. By recognizing the Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, lists, and code blocks), you can intelligently divide the content based on its structure and hierarchy, resulting in more semantically coherent chunks. For example: from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownTextSplitter markdown_text = \"...\" markdown_splitter = MarkdownTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0) docs = markdown_splitter.create_documents([markdown_text]) • LaTex: LaTeX is a document preparation system and markup language often used for academic papers and technical documents. By parsing the LaTeX commands and environments, you can create chunks that respect the logical organization of the content (e.g., sections, subsections, and equations), leading to more accurate and contextually relevant results. For example: from langchain.text_splitter import LatexTextSplitter latex_text = \"...\" latex_splitter = LatexTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0) docs = latex_splitter.create_documents([latex_text]) Figuring out the best chunk size for your application Here are some pointers to help you come up with an optimal chunk size if the common chunking approaches, like fixed chunking, don’t easily apply to your use case. Preprocessing your Data - You need to first pre-process your data to ensure quality before determining the best chunk size for your application. For example, if your data has been retrieved from the web, you might need to remove HTML tags or specific elements that just add noise. Selecting a Range of Chunk Sizes - Once your data is preprocessed, the next step is to choose a range of potential chunk sizes to test. As mentioned previously, the choice should take into account the nature of the content (e.g., short messages or lengthy documents), the embedding model you’ll use, and its capabilities (e.g., token limits). The objective is to find a balance between preserving context and maintaining accuracy. Start by exploring a variety of chunk sizes, including smaller chunks (e.g., 128 or 256 tokens) for capturing more granular semantic information and larger chunks (e.g., 512 or 1024 tokens) for retaining more context. Evaluating the Performance of Each Chunk Size - In order to test various chunk sizes, you can either use multiple indices or a single index with multiple namespaces. With a representative dataset, create the embeddings for the chunk sizes you want to test and save them in your index (or indices). You can then run a series of queries for which you can evaluate quality, and compare the performance of the various chunk sizes. This is most likely to be an iterative process, where you test different chunk sizes against different queries until you can determine the best-performing chunk size for your content and expected queries. Conclusion Chunking your content is pretty simple in most cases - but it could present some challenges when you start wandering off the beaten path. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to chunking, so what works for one use case may not work for another. Hopefully, this post will help you get a better intuition for how to approach chunking for your application. =============== what text splitter you used ? as mentioned above we used 1. CharacterTextSplitter 2)NLTKTextSplitter 3)SpacyTextSplitter 4)LatexTextSplitter 5)RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/ we have many text splitter but RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is good one ============== 8.Have you tried implementing, filtering query, meta data filtering when you are doing your application, how did you approach that? https://medium.com/@gmarcilhacy/deep-dive-into-langchain-and-pinecone-metadata-filtering-75a9b6eba9c =================== 9.Have you stored any meta data along with that? 10.How would you do => Pre-Filtering/Post Filtering? Pre-Filtering with KNN and stuff like that, what would happen when you do Query with Metadata and what Scenario would you use that and stuff like that? KNN – https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-search-filtering/ ===================== atmach 2 1. In the DB’s there are different Search Engines, what different search engines did you use (-what type of search engines did you use in DB search? Bob) • NMS lib When dealing with vector databases, especially in the context of search engines or systems that perform similarity searches within large datasets, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is a technique often used in computer vision to filter or select the most relevant objects or points after detection processes. However, when it comes to similarity searches in vector databases, the focus shifts towards finding vectors that are most similar to a given query vector, and here, algorithms and libraries designed for efficient vector search and indexing play a crucial role. Below are several libraries and systems that are often used for similar purposes in vector databases, focusing on efficient search in high-dimensional spaces: 1. Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Developed by Facebook AI, Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It supports indexing large scale vectors and performs similarity search with high efficiency. Faiss is particularly well-suited for applications that require searching through large volumes of high-dimensional vectors, making it a popular choice for implementing search engines that operate on vector spaces. 2. Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): Annoy is a C++ library with Python bindings to search for points in space that are close to a given query point. It prioritizes speed and memory usage efficiency, making it suitable for real-time queries in large datasets. Annoy is used extensively in recommendation systems, for music analysis, and in various machine learning applications where nearest neighbor search is critical. 3. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): HNSW is an algorithm that is implemented in several libraries, including the popular nmslib (Non-Metric Space Library). It is designed for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces and is known for its balance between search speed and accuracy. HNSW achieves high performance through a graph-based approach, making it effective for tasks that require fast retrieval from large datasets. 4. ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): Developed by Google Research, ScaNN is a library designed for efficient vector similarity search at scale. It can be used to search through millions of vectors for the nearest neighbors with high accuracy and minimal computational resources. ScaNN utilizes techniques such as quantization and partitioning to achieve its efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale applications in machine learning and data retrieval systems. 5. Elasticsearch with Vector Search: Elasticsearch, a popular open-source search and analytics engine, has introduced vector search capabilities in recent versions. By leveraging dense vector fields and similarity scoring functions, Elasticsearch can perform similarity searches on vector data, enabling applications like semantic search, personalization, and recommendation systems.'"
